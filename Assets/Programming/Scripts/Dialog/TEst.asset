    sentences:
    - Faith...
    - What is faith in the land of needless death.
    - Where children starve.
    - 'living flesh wilts, '
    - and tears freeze on your chin.
    - What is faith to us.
    - A lie.
    - Told over and over.
    - Until even the unfaithfull begin to believe.
    - A hope that one day we will be saved.
    - But that day will never come.
    - Becuase a lie will always remain,
    - A lie.
